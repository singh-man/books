OO Concepts
===========

### If-Else style

- novice developer: uses if-else may be switch
- avg developer: overloading
- good developer: overriding (running short of english text words) (overriding changes the behavior in a way that is not compatible with the base class's behavior, it violates LSP). [More](#s-o-l-i-d)
- god developer: delegates logic to data-structure or functional paradigm

### OO Defination

#### Abstraction
Concept of hiding the details of implementation and exposing only the necessary functionalities. The keywords to keep in mind here are: 'Implementation hiding'.

#### Encapsulation
Concept of encapsulating or wrapping up the member variables (data) and the methods (behavior) of an object into a single unit, such as a class.

**(funny term)** takes the part that vary and encapsulate it so that it will not effect the other things. Here's another way to think about this principle: take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts what vary without affecting those that don't and then remember to program to an interfaces (provide a constructor or setter/getter injection to provide the concrete object).

Encapsulation is literally a way to design so that object will never go into **invalid state** or at least make it to **fail fast**

#### Inheritance (Is-A) - [Type Of]
Establishes a hierarchical relationship between two classes. Inherited dependency (but can exist independently)
- BAD BAD!!
    - **extends** avoid using it, unless mandated by some framework. Use **composition** or **mixin**.
    - Makes hierarchial chain tightly coupled
    - A inherits from B" means both "A contains all data B contains" and "A can do everything B can do. **This is a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle right in the language**
    - Inheriting from an interface/abstract class **(without data)** is one thing; inheriting from a fully functional class is bizarre.
    - Small changes can impact a large amount of code through the inheritance tree.
    - inheritance is "better" (read: needs less code) for components of a program that never or rarely changes. BUT inheritance leads to hard to refactor and more rigid code. Once you change the behavior of a base class you have to make sure it won't break anything in one of it's subclass
    - Composition leads to more code, but it's much more flexible. Every object handles only it's own data so it's much easier to change something without breaking any other part of the code. It's also much easier to read and understand the code because it's always linear.
    - Fragile Ibheritance: changes made to a base class (superclass) can unintentionally break the functionality of its derived classes (subclasses), even if the changes appear safe on their own. e.g. B extends A, if a value is changed in A will B remain safe or complete B's call hierarchy will be impacted.

#### Composition (Has-A) [Owns A]
Strong dependency (can not exist independently) delegate can come here (**hardcoded in constructor via new opertor**). Class is responsible for the lifetime of the object it contains.

#### Aggregation (Uses-A) [Uses A]
Loose dependency (can exist independently) (data and its behaviour should follow this) delegates can come here. **dependency provided**. Class is not responsible for the lifetime of the object it contains.

> Aggregation over (loose coupling) > Composition over (strong coupled) > Inheritance (tightly coupled)
>> Goalng has no inheritance of data it uses **composition** to enhance data, use that technique.
>>> Avoid coupling Data and behaviour [Tell Don't Ask](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html). Also it alligns better to functional paradigm.
>>> Circle-ellipse or PersonWalk-PrisonWalk like problem can be avoided by not using inheritance.

#### Association
Objects knows eachother

#### Polymorphism
Capability of an object to be represented in different forms.
- Polymorphism hard to test in real time systems
    - Performance Overhead
    - Non-Deterministic Behavior (Liskov Substitution)
    - Difficult to Debug
    - Memory Management Challenges

#### Misc:
- Class -> is a blueprint/template, has members like:
    - Field -> (generally known as variables); holds the **state** of the program. **Invalid State** root cause of most of the **bugs**.
    - Methods -> operate on field(s) (state)
    - Object -> also called instance; runtime instance of class in memory
- Interface -> Defines the behaviour of system
    - Interfaces are not designed they are discovered as the system grows Start with specific behaviour and then discover abstractions as commonality emerges
    - **Rule of 3 -> unless there are 3 examples of code that looks similar avoid abstraction**
    - Letting the **client define the interface** is much better than the vice versa Clients define the interfaces (because they consume it) and interface decision must be what the clients consume
    - **Role interfaces (with one member)**: is better in handling **liskov substituion** also fits the functional paradigm.
- **Objects** are data with behavoiur 
- **Functions** are pure behaviour
- **Closures** are behaviours with data
- Refrence -> a variable that points to an object
    - Instance variables causes threading issues and needs **sync** or **locks**, local variables, referring to some objects; if within the **thread stack** are **thread safe**
- Memory
    - Heap: -> **Not Thread safe** :: all objects irr-respective of local or instance even primitive types at instance level. Heap memory is a type of dynamic memory allocation used for storing objects and data structures that require a longer lifespan than stack memory. 
    - Thread Stack: -> **Thread Safe** (if within the method scope) :: Stack memory is a sort of memory allocation that the OS continuously manages and uses to store local variables in a LIFO order. All local variables (not the objects its referring to)  
- import x.y.z.* on this package classes are imported not sub-packages
- Data hiding can practically be termed as implementation hiding
- Getters (queires) -> preferably returns some value but are definitely indempotent, setters (commands) -> preferably returns void
  
### Reference type

#### Soft reference
A soft reference is one of the strengths or levels of 'non strong' reference defined in the Java programming language, the others being weak and phantom.The garbage collector will always collect weakly referenced objects, but will only collect softly referenced objects when its algorithms decide that memory is low enough to warrant it. Soft and weak references provide two quasi-priorities for non-strongly referenced objects. Soft references may be used, for example, when writing a cache: weakly referenced objects may disappear too quickly to make the cache useful.

#### Weak reference:
In computer programming, a weak reference is a reference that does not protect the referenced object from collection by a garbage collector. An object referenced only by weak references is considered unreachable (or "weakly reachable") and so may be collected at any time. Weak references are used to avoid keeping memory references by unneeded objects. Some garbage-collected languages feature or support various levels of weak references, such as Java, C#, Python, Perl or Lisp

#### Phantom reference:
An object is phantomly referenced after it has been finalized, but before its allocated memory has been reclaimed.

#### Circular reference:
A circular reference is a series of references where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.
The Sun JRE does treat SoftReferences differently from WeakReferences. *We attempt to hold on to object referenced by a SoftReference if there isn't pressure on the available memory. One detail: the policy for the "-client" and "-server" JRE's are different: the -client JRE tries to keep your footprint small by preferring to clear SoftReferences rather than expand the heap, whereas the -server JRE tries to keep your performance high by preferring to expand the heap (if possible) rather than clear SoftReferences. One size does not fit all.*

#### S O [L] I D
1. Liskov substitution (applies to classes not interface)
    1. append only
    2. If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.
    1. keep the system correct (don't go out of the boundries of the system)
    1. Probable reason of violoation
        1. NotSupportedException indicates the violation of liskov substitution
        1. Extracted interfaces/abstraction (after coding)
        1. downcast
        1. Often violated when an attempt to remove feature
        2. hashcode/equals overriden in sub-class
1. Reused abstraction principle compliance indicates liskov substitution principle compliance
2. Circle-Ellipse or PersonWalk-PrisonWalk problem breaks liskov substition.

### DI principle
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
1. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

### Others
Decorator patter is well suiter for Quieris(getters) better than composition (can be used for caching after save) Decorator is like russian doll.

### Predicate Programming
Predicate (mathematical logic) / computing too :
In mathematics, a predicate is commonly understood to be a Boolean-valued function P: Xâ†’ {true, false}, called the predicate on X.
predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables.

## AOP
job of an aspect is called advice. Advice defines both the what and the when of an aspect. In addition to describing the job that an aspect will perform, advice addresses the question of when to perform the job. Should it be applied before a method is invoked? After the method is invoked? Both before and after method invocation? Or should it only be applied if a method throws an exception?

Application may have thousands of opportunities for advice to be applied. These opportunities are known as joinpoints. A joinpoint is a point in the execution of the application where an aspect can be plugged in.

If advice defines the what and when of aspects then pointcuts define the where. A pointcut definition matches one or more joinpoints at which advice should be woven. an aspect doesnâ€™t necessarily advise all joinpoints in an application.pointcuts using explicit class and method names or through regular expressions that define matching class and method name patterns

An aspect(the advisor we create in spring which combines advice and pointcust is aspect) is the merger of advice and pointcuts.

Interceptor is an aspect; it consist of advice and pointcut (means an advisor)

Interface Performer 	Class Instrumentalist 	Class Vocal

Audience : take seat, applause etc. is a concern that need to be aspected on Performer interface AudienceAdvice : defines what to do(we inject audience object and triggers the concerns on it) and when to do(Before, after, after throwing, around) implements MethodBeforeAdvice / MethodAfterAdvice / AfterThrowing or MethodInterceptor 1. traditional way

```xml
<!-- ASPECT/ADVISOR combines advice and pointcut--> 
<bean id="audienceAdvisor" class="org.springframework.aop.support.RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor"> 	
    <property name="advice" ref="audienceAdvice" /> 	
    <property name="pattern" value=".*perform" /> 
</bean> 

<bean id="duke" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean"> 	
    <property name="target" ref="dukeTarget" /><!-- target object--> 	
    <property name="interceptorNames" value="audienceAdvisor" /> <!-- aspect: can be a list of advisors too--> 	
    <property name="proxyInterfaces" value="com.springinaction.springidol.Performer" /> 
</bean> 
```
actual call flow happens: duke proxy -> audienceAdvisor -> target 

2. @Aspect way 
But with @~AspectJ annotations, we can revisit our Audience class and turn it into an aspect without the need for any additional classes or bean declarations. 

No need of writing an advice Concern can be declared as an Aspect and Pointcut can be declared on its method hence - *@Aspect and @pointcut annotation eliminates writing a new Advice* java class and declaring pointcuts and advisor in xml configuration

### IOC vs DI
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** where the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred to an external framework or container, 
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a specific implementation of IoC where dependencies are provided externally to a class. DI is a way to achieve IoC, making it a more general concept than DI

#### Strangler pattern
Software design pattern used to incrementally modernize a system, especially monolithic applications, by replacing parts with new services. It involves introducing a proxy layer (facade) that initially routes requests to the legacy system while new functionalities are added in parallel. As new services become operational, the proxy gradually redirects traffic to them, eventually phasing out the legacy system

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
software design pattern that enhances system resilience and fault tolerance, especially in distributed systems. It works by monitoring a service or API and, when a certain failure threshold is reached, "tripping" the circuit, which temporarily prevents further calls to that service, allowing it time to recover. This prevents cascading failures and ensures the overall system remains stable
