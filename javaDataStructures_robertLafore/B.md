#### Data Structures and Algorithms

> The definitive reference for any study of data structures and
> algorithms is *The Art of Computer Programming* by Donald E. Knuth, of
> Stanford University (Addison Wesley, 1998). This seminal work,
> originally published in the 1970s, is now in its third edition. It
> consists of three volumes (recently made available in a boxed set):
> *Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms*, *Volume 2: Seminumerical
> Algorithms*, and *Volume 3: Sorting and Searching*. Of these, the last
> is the most relevant to the topics in this book. This work is highly
> mathematical and does not make for easy reading, but it is the bible
> for anyone contemplating serious research in the field.
>
> A somewhat more accessible text is Robert Sedgewick's *Algorithms in
> C++* (Addison Wesley, 1998). This book is adapted from the earlier
> *Algorithms* (Addison Wesley, 1988) in which the code examples were
> written in Pascal. It is comprehensive and authoritative. The text and
> code exam- ples are quite compact, and require close reading.
>
> *Algorithms in Java* by Robert Sedgewick and Michael Schidlowsky
> (Addison Wesley, 2002) covers the ground in Java.
>
> A good text for an undergraduate course in data structures and
> algorithms is *Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++: Walls
> and Mirrors* by Janet J. Prichard and Frank M. Carrano (Benjamin
> Cummings, 2001). There are many illustrations, and the chapters end
> with exercises and

> projects. The Java version is *Data Abstraction and Problem Solving
> with Java: Walls and Mirrors* by Frank M. Carrano and Janet L.
> Prichard.
>
> *Practical Algorithms in C++* by Bryan Flamig (John Wiley and Sons,
> 1995) covers many of the usual topics in addition to some not
> frequently covered by other books, such as algorithm generators and
> string searching.
>
> *Programming Pearls* by Jon Louis Bentley (Addison Wesley, 1999) was
> originally written in 1986 but is nevertheless stuffed full of great
> advice for the programmer. Much of the material deals with data
> structures and algorithms.
>
> Some other worthwhile texts on data structures and algorithms are
> *Classic Data Structures in C++* by Timothy A. Budd (Addison Wesley,
> 2000); *Data Structures and Problem Solving Using C++* by Mark Allen
> Weiss (Addison Wesley, 1999); and *Data Structures Using C and C++* by
> Yedidyah Langsam et al. (Prentice Hall, 1996).

#### Object-Oriented Programming Languages

> For an accessible and thorough introduction to Java and
> object-oriented program- ming, try *Object-Oriented Programming in
> Java* by Stephen Gilbert and Bill McCarty (Waite Group Press, 1997).
>
> If you're interested in C++, try *Object-Oriented Programming in C++,
> Fourth Edition*, by Robert Lafore (Sams Publishing, 2001).
>
> *The Java Programming Language*, *Third Edition*, by Ken Arnold, James
> Gosling, and David Holmes (Addison Wesley, 2000) deals with Java
> syntax and is certainly author- itative (although briefer than many
> books): Gosling, who works at Sun Microsystems, is the creator of
> Java.
>
> *Core Java 2, Fifth Edition,* by Cay S. Horstmann and Gary Cornell
> (Prentice Hall, 2000) is a multivolume series that covers in depth but
> very accessibly almost every- thing you want to know about programming
> in Java.

#### Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Software Engineering

> For an easy, non-academic introduction to software engineering, try
> *The Object Primer: The Application Developer's Guide to
> Object-Orientation, Second Edition,* by Scott
>
> W. Ambler (Cambridge University Press, 2001). This short book explains
> in plain language how to design a large software application. The
> title is a bit of a misnomer; it goes way beyond mere OO concepts.
>
> *Object-Oriented Design in Java* by Stephen Gilbert and Bill McCarty
> (Waite Group Press, 1998) is an unusually accessible text.
>
> Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and Software Engineering 737
>
> A classic in the field of OOD is *Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
> with Applications* by Grady Booch (Addison Wesley, 1994). The author
> is one of the pioneers in this field and the creator of the Booch
> notation for depicting class relationships. This book isn't easy for
> beginners, but is essential for more advanced readers.
>
> An early book on OOD is *The Mythical Man-Month* by Frederick P.
> Brooks, Jr. (Addison Wesley, 1975, reprinted in 1995), which explains
> in a very clear and literate way some of the reasons why good software
> design is necessary. It is said to have sold more copies than any
> other computer book.
>
> Other good texts on OOD are *An Introduction to Object-Oriented
> Programming, Third Edition*, by Timothy Budd (Addison Wesley, 2002);
> *Object-Oriented Design Heuristics* by Arthur J. Riel (Addison Wesley,
> 1996); and *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object- Oriented
> Software* by Erich Gamma et al. (Addison Wesley, 1995).
